# Sample Data Sets
These data sets are ones I use in my demos and while building applications so that I can simulate real world data

## Baseball Data
Data is from http://www.retrosheet.org. Retrosheet has baseball statistic data going all the way back to the 1800's in some forms. This database is at the granularity of an event within a game (i.e. per pitch).
